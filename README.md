# WOL_PROJECT
This is a live html code editor. It currently has only basic futionality like minimal syntax hilighting and live output window.
It has been made by embedding an open source code editor called ace and importing its javascript liraries for functionality.
ACE is an opensource code editor fully made using javascript and has performance close to that of a native code editor.
